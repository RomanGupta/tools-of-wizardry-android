"Tools of Wizardry" strives to become a helpful Tool for Wizards 
in RPG Games based on Pathfinder or Dungeons & Dragons. 

So far, it supports (swipe between features):
1. Sacred Geometry Solver / Calculator - 100% correctly with brackets up to rank 14 (100% success anyway for rank 14+ at any spell level)
2. Arithmancy Solver / Calculator

More features are planned for future releases, first of all a basic spell repository and a spell book.

You may find the app in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rge.android.tools.of.wizardry).

So far, this Android application relies heavily on the logic another project - 
the ["Tools of Wizardry"-library](https://github.com/RomanGupta/tools-of-wizardry).
